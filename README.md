# Amazon-Reviews-Based-Product-Recommendation-System
Performed Text Analysis/NLP/Sentiment Analysis for about 568,000 Amazon Product Reviews. 
Developed user profiles using tag words from product and user reviews. 
Implemented a model using K-means Clustering algorithm to perform item based collaborative filtering.
Amazon's recommendation system generates 35% of its total revenue and they use item-to-item
collaborative filtering algorithm. The system matches a customer’s purchased and rated items to
similar products in their list, which are then selected to be part of their recommendations.
According to statista, 197 million people around the world order from amazon and 10% of the
total population actively reviews. This accounts to 19.7 million reviews going unnoticed.
Customer reviews are a great source of “Voice of the customer” and could offer tremendous
insights into what customers like and dislike about a product or service. As a team we thought
why not take into account this 19.7 million population and take user experience to the next level.
Weather you are watching a movie or listening to songs or simply shopping only
recommendation technology helps customer centric companies increase their ROI by fruitfully
leveraging personalization and recommendations.
We will be using Amazon dataset provided by Stanford professor J.Leskov which has 568,454
instances and 9 columns. Our project will include a descriptive analysis followed by sentimental
analysis using NLP and Text analysis and then we’ll conclude our analysis by recommending
products for the customer. The impact of the project is to increase revenue as well as enhance
customer satisfaction by personalizing the shopping experience.
